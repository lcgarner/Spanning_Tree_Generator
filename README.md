## Spanning_Tree_Generator
An educational tool to help students learn basic graph theory!

# Overview
Spanning_Tree_Generator is an interactive graph-building tool that enables users to create their own graphs and visualize a spanning tree generated using Depth-First Search (DFS). This project offers an intuitive interface for graph construction and provides a visual representation of spanning trees overlaid on the original graph.

# Features
- Interactive Graph Building: Click to place nodes and drag between nodes to create edges, designing your custom graph.
- Spanning Tree Visualization: After building your graph, generate and view a spanning tree drawn in red over your original graph, providing a clear distinction and understanding of the spanning tree structure.

# How to Use
Start the Application: 
- Run the application from the Driver class, which opens the BuildGraph window.
Build Your Graph:
- Place nodes by clicking within the window.
- Create edges by pressing and dragging from one node to another.
- Ensure nodes are interconnected with edges for the DFS algorithm to traverse.
- Generate Spanning Tree: Click the "Get Spanning Tree" button to visualize the spanning tree overlaying the original graph in a new window.

# Testing
Explore the functionality and robustness of the Spanning Tree Generator by running included tester classes, such as GenericTester, which validates the core components (Nodes, Edges, Graphs) of the application.

Enjoy creating complex or simple graphs and visualizing how spanning trees connect their nodes in an optimized, non-cyclical manner.
