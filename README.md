# Spanning_Tree_Generator

## Overview
Spanning_Tree_Generator is an interactive graph-building tool that enables users to create their own graphs and visualize a spanning tree generated using Depth-First Search (DFS). This project offers an intuitive interface for graph construction and provides a visual representation of spanning trees overlaid on the original graph.

## Features
- Interactive Graph Building: Click to place nodes and drag between nodes to create edges, designing your custom graph.
- Spanning Tree Visualization: After building your graph, generate and view a spanning tree drawn in red over your original graph, providing a clear distinction and understanding of the spanning tree structure.

## How to Use

Clone the repository.

Start the Application: 
- Run the application from the Driver class, which opens the BuildGraph window.
  
Build Your Graph:
- Place nodes by clicking within the window.
- Create edges by pressing and dragging from one node to another.
- Ensure nodes are interconnected with edges for the DFS algorithm to traverse.

Generate Spanning Tree: 
- Click the "Get Spanning Tree" button to visualize the spanning tree overlaying the original graph in a new window.
